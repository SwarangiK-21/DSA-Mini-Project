# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis: Driving Profit with Data (EDA Mini-Project)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This mini-project demonstrates the application of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the **R programming language** and the `tidyverse` suite to uncover critical business insights from a multi-city coffee shop sales dataset. The primary goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable intelligence, focusing on profitability, seasonal trends, and product performance.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives

The analysis focused on answering strategic business questions through data visualization:

1.  **Geographic Performance:** Identify the highest and lowest **profit-generating cities and branches**.
2.  **Product Profitability:** Determine which **product categories** drive the highest revenue versus the highest profit margin.
3.  **Time Series Analysis:** Uncover **seasonal sales trends** and identify peak revenue periods (e.g., specific months).
4.  **Transaction Behavior:** Explore the relationship between **Unit Price** and **Quantity Sold** to understand sales elasticity.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

* **Language:** **R** (version 4.x)
* **Core Packages:**
    * `tidyverse` (for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization)
    * `ggplot2` (for all visual plots)
    * `dplyr` (for data wrangling and summarization)
    * `lubridate` (for date and time operations)
* **Environment:** RStudio

## 📊 Data Preparation and Cleaning

The initial dataset was a clean transactional record, requiring minimal imputation.

| Step | Action Taken | R Function Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Type Conversion** | Converted `DATE` from character to the R `Date` format. | `lubridate::ymd()` |
| **Feature Creation** | Extracted `Month` and `Year` to enable time-series aggregation. | `lubridate::month()` / `lubridate::year()` |
| **Categorical Structuring** | Converted key categorical columns (`City`, `PRODUCT_CATEGORY`, etc.) to **factors** to ensure correct statistical grouping and visualization. | `factor()` / `mutate()` |

## 📈 Analysis & Key Insights (Visual Evidence)

The EDA generated several core visualizations, each providing a clear answer to a business question:

### 1. Monthly Revenue Trend (Time Series)
* **Visual:** Line plot showing total revenue aggregated by month.
* **Insight:** Identified **clear seasonal peaks** (e.g., summer months) and troughs, essential for inventory and staffing optimization.

### 2. Profit Margin by City (Geographic Comparison)
* **Visual:** Horizontal bar plot comparing the total profit generated by each **`City`**.
* **Insight:** Revealed a significant disparity in profitability, pinpointing the **top-performing city** (e.g., Los Angeles) and highlighting areas for improvement.

### 3. Revenue Breakdown by Product Category
* **Visual:** Horizontal bar plot showing total revenue contributions from categories like 'Coffee Beverages', 'Snacks', and 'Cold Drinks'.
* **Insight:** Provided a clear picture of the **product mix**, showing which categories must be prioritized due to their high sales volume.

### 4. Revenue Distribution and Outliers (Box Plot)
* **Visual:** Box plot of `REVENUE` distributed across different `City` categories.
* **Insight:** Verified data consistency and identified **high-value outliers**, suggesting the possibility of large corporate orders or wholesale business, a potential new segment to explore.
